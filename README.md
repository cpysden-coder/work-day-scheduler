#word-day-scheduler README
check out the scheduler at : https://cpysden-coder.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

For some reason my original readme got out of sync with my local and so can't upload the local. 

This scheduler is designed to meet the following criteria
User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
